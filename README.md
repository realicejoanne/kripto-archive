# What is Cryptography?

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

In Cryptography, there are seveal ciphers I learned:
1. Shift Cipher
2. ROT13
3. Affine Cipher
4. Hill Cipher
5. Vigenère Cipher
6. Autokey Cipher
7. Columnar Transposition Cipher
8. Triangle Cipher
9. Route/Spiral Cipher
10. Diagonal Cipher
11. Zigzag Cipher
12. Elgamal Cipher
13. RSA Cipher
14. DES Cipher
15. S-DES Cipher
